## Description
Regardless of the quality of your analyses and data-related findings, if you cannot effectively communicate them, their impact will be severely limited. Technical skills in this module will focus on a step-by-step walk through the process of choosing, creating, and modifying data visualizations in Python. Discussions will include general design principles applicable to other data visualization software used in industry and academia (eg. R, Tableau, PowerBI). Case studies and ‘real world’ examples are incorporated throughout. Ethics components include incorporating reproducibility with data visualization, building awareness of the decision making that goes into sharing data visually, and addressing inequity in data visualization by focusing on accessible design.

This Module is designed for those who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science and data visualization skills for their career.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1.	Create and customize data visualizations start to finish in Python
2.	Use general design principles for creating accessible and equitable data visualizations in Python and other software
3.	Use data visualization to purposely tell a story

## Logistics

### Module Contacts
**Questions can be submitted to the #questions channel on Slack**

* Technical Facilitator: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the Technical Facilitator can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.
* Learning Support Staff: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the Technical Facilitator can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.

### Delivery of module
The module will run sychronously up three times a week on Zoom. The first three days are used as "lectures" and will last a maximum of 3 hours. During this time, the Technical Facilitator will introduce the concepts for the week. The last day is used for as optional, asychronous work period. The work periods will also last for up to 3 hours. During these days, an Technical Facilitator or TA will be present on Zoom to assist learners reach the intended learning outcomes.

### How the Technical Facilitator will deliver
The Technical Facilitators will introduce the concepts through a collaborative live coding session usiing the Python notebooks found under `/01-slides`. All Technical Facilitators will also upload any live coding files to this repository for any learners to revisit under `/live-code`.
 
### Expectations
Learners are encouraged to be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout the module.

## Policies
* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this Module more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Module communications:** Communications take place over email or on Slack. If communicating over email, please include "DSI-Visualization" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Visualization: Visualization question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which **is not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be two assignments which **are** graded.
 
## Requirements
* Learners are not expected to have any coding experience, we designed the learning contents for beginners.
* Learners are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
* Learners must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Learners are expected to follow along with the coding.
* Learners must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code in order to complete assignments. It should be use as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect learners to have completed the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/Onboarding/tree/tech-onboarding-docs).
* Camera is optional although highly encouraged. We understand that not everyone may have the space at home to have the camera on.

### Lesson Schedule
* TBD: Intro and overview, getting started with matplotlib
* TBD: Exploring matplotlib, reproducible data visualization
* TBD: Customizing our plots
* TBD: Choosing the right visualization 
* TBD: Subplots and combining visualizations + Accessible data visualization

## Acknowledgements and Contributions
* I wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
