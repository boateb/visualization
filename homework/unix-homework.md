# **Unix Shell Homework**
```console
$ echo "Data Sciences Institute"
$ echo "by: Rachael Lam"
```

##### **Expectations**
The goal of this homework is not to grade the competancy of what was learned, but to give students an opportunity to practice. This will help students remember the content and prepare for the next class.

Because each class builds upon the last, it's important to review the content, as time is too limited for a full in-class review.
