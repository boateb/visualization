##### **Introduction**
At a certain point, we'll be entering the professional world. We'll learn a few tactics and skills to help us succeed in this environment.

If we're already in this professional world, we'll reintroduce or reinforce practises that will us an advantage.

## `Crunch Mode`

---
<!--_color: white -->
<!--_backgroundColor: #33857a -->
Who has worked wayyy too many hours in a day/week?

Did you feel like you were productive?

---
A scientific study looking at overwork found two main points:
> 1. Working more than eight hours a day for more than a couple of weeks of time lowers your total productivity, not just your hourly productivity—i.e., you get less done in total (not just per hour) when you're in crunch mode than you do when you work regular hours.

---
> 2. Working over 21 hours in a stretch increases the odds of you making a catastrophic error just as much as being legally drunk.

While Henry Ford was originally criticized for adopting a 40 hour work week in 1926, we're going through a similar challenge of adopting a 4 day work week.

---
We slowly decrease our effectiveness the more tired we are yet we don't always realize that our ability is declining.

Working longer, doesn't necessarily mean we're doing better work. In fact, we run the risk of making mistakes that could cause many headaches for those we're collaborating with.

Unfortunately, 

**Produce good work by getting good rest. Take care of your mental health and you'll make better decisions**

## `Time Management`

---
<!--_color: white -->
<!--_backgroundColor: #33857a -->
What are some of your methods for time management?

---
Greg Wilson outlines 7 time managment methods.
1. Make a list of the things you have to do.

2. Weed out everything that you don't need to do right away.
3. Sort the list so that the most important tasks are at the top.
4. Make sure you have everything you need to see the first task through.
5. Turn off interruptions.
6. Set an alarm to go off in fifty minutes.
7. Take a ten-minute break.

---
Break down bigger tasks (Wilson suggests taks that are more than an hour) into smaller pieces. 

One task could even be, *"Plan To Dos"*

Getting back into a productive flow after an interruption can take anywhere between several seconds and several minutes. This adds up!

**Remember, not everyone works the same. It's important to always adopt what works best for you!**

---
> If you are neurotypical and have neurodivergent teammates, ask them what works well for them rather than ignoring the difference or guessing what they might want. Please do the same if you have teammates who have difficulty seeing, hearing, or moving about: they have expertise you don't.

## `Meetings`

---
<!--_color: white -->
<!--_backgroundColor: #33857a -->
What about meetings do you find frustrating?

---
![center](pics/email.jpeg)

---
##### **1. Agree on the rules**
- Everyone should agree on what the rules are of a meeting

- For example, you could require everyone to show up on time and and have everyone's voices be heard equally

---
##### **2. Keep discussion meetings and decision meetings separate.**
- Discussion Meetings:
    - Explore design alternatives or next term's goals
    - Wide-ranging
<br>
- Decision Meetings:
    - Choosing which alternatives to persue
    - Short and focused

---
##### **3. Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting**
- Sharing information can be kept to an email

- Meetings are great for discussion, deicisons and brainstorming

---
##### **4. Write an agenda**
- An agenda will show the importance of what needs to be discussed
<br>

##### **5. Include timings in the agenda**
- This will help prevent time taken from other important things that needs to be discussed

- Figure out why a meeting ran over time to better prepare for the next one

---
##### **6. Prioritize**
- First, tackle issues with high impact but take little time

- Save things that will take more time and are less impactful for the end of the meeting

---
##### **7. Make one person responsible for keeping things moving.**
- Deligate a moderator to keep track of time, making sure people are not distracting, and making sure some don't take up too much air time

- Historically, certain people have been heard more than others. Make sure that everyone in the room feels comfortable participating and everyone's voices are heard.

---
##### **8. Require politeness**
- No one can be rude

- No one gets to ramble

- Off topic conversations can be discussed elsewhere

---
> People often reach for positive statements like "assume good intent" because they're worried about people being "shamed" over innocent mistakes. But society at large is already inclined to assume good intent in people with power and privilege–even when they're not demonstrating it. If you want to build a culture of "assuming good intent," start by assuming good intent in marginalized people. Assume that they already tried being nice. Assume that their feelings are valid. Assume that, after a lifetime of practice, they are responding to harmful behavior in the way that is safest for them. Prioritize that safety over the momentary discomfort people feel when they realize they've done something hurtful.

---
##### **9. No interruptions**
- If someone wants to speak, participants make it known non-verbally (to not interrupt)

- The moderator can keep track of who wants to speak and give them time

---
##### **10. No distractions**
- Side conversations, texting, checking emails, etc can all indicate that they don't think what the speaker has to say or their work is important.

---
##### **11. Take minutes**
- Take point-form notes about the most important things that were shared during the meeting

---
##### **12. End early**
- Ending early gives people a break before they have to get back to their work
<br>

---
##### **Post Meeting**
- At the end of the meeting, make the notes accessible so those that were not at the meeting can still stay informed.

- Written notes gives everyone a chance to correct mistakes, misinterpretations or misrepresentations

- Make sure questions and action items are followed up to help with the next meeting

## `Air Time`

---
Some people naturally will speak more than others. It's important to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak and that no one takes more space than others.

---
##### **Three Sticky Notes**
- Each participant gets three sticky notes (or paper clips, ripped pieces of paper, anything that works)

- Each time someone speaks, they give up a sticky note

- Once they're out, they can't speak for the rest of the meeting

---
##### **Online Meetings**
- Keep track of people who want to speak by using the chat

- Although we may want everyone's camera on, remember that working from home provides other challenges. Some may not have the space to have their camera on and that should be respected.

---

## `Making Decisions`

---
To make decisions, it's important to acknowledge the power structure of the team.
<br>
1. Formal (accountable)
    - Larger groups need governance to make decisions

<br>

2. Informal (unaccountable)
    - Small groups (less than 6)

---
<!-- footer: Wilson-->
##### **Martha's Rules**

1. Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal. Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered at that meeting, and must include:
    - a one-line summary
    - the full text of the proposal
    - any required background information
    - pros and cons
    - possible alternatives

---
2. A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are present.

3. Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it. The group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their delegate is present. The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the item to the group.

---
4. After the sponsor presents the proposal a sense vote is cast for the proposal prior to any discussion:
    - Who likes the proposal?
    - Who can live with the proposal?
    - Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?
<br>

5. If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal, it passes with no further discussion.

---
6. If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is sent back to its sponsor for further work. (The sponsor may decide to drop it if it's clear that the majority isn't going to support it.)

---
7. If some members are uncomfortable with the proposal, a timer is set for a brief discussion moderated by the meeting moderator. After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add, the moderator calls for a straight yes-or-no vote on the question: "Should we implement this decision over the stated objections?" If a majority votes "yes" the proposal is implemented. Otherwise, it is returned to the sponsor for further work.

## `Code Reviews`

---
Code Reviews are a cost-effective way to find bugs in the software. It also allows us to share knowledge between team members by reading other's code.

There are many guidelines documenting how to do good code reviews. Wilson references the SmartBear guide that we'll reiterate here.

---
##### **1. Have the instructor do a demonstration review**
- It's helpful to have a demonstration on how to do a code review to understand how much detail is expected

- Demonstrations can include sample code and a think aloud commenting

---
##### **2. Authors should clean up code before review**
- To make code easier to review, we should clean our code (ex. variable names) and add comments to improve readability

- It's also possible that errors will be found by the author during this clean up

---
##### **3. Review at most 200 lines of a code at a time**
- A rule of thumb is that a Pull Request should be no longer than 200 lines, therefore, review should be no longer than 200 to begin with

- Code reviews can be up to 400 lines but start small when beginning with code reviews

---
##### **4. Use checklists**
- Checklists include the most common problems to look out for. To begin, ask for no more than 12 otherwise it could be overwhelming.

- You can also keep a list of errors that keep occuring to keep in mind as you're coding.

---
##### **5. Offer alternatives**
- Help fix code rather than just what is wrong
<br>

##### **6. Don't feign surprise or pass judgment**
- It just doesn't feel good to be judged or made to feel incompetent.

---
##### **7. Don't overwhelm people with details**
- If you see an error throughout the code (ex. variable `x` is overused), don't comment ever time you see it. Comment the first couple instances

---
##### **8. Don't try to sneak in feature requests**
- Code reviews should stick to bugs rather than introducing new functionalities

---
##### **9. Follow up**
- Suggestions don't always have to be accepted but they should be rejected with good reason.

- GitHub allows for discussion threads for each comment.    
    - Reviewers can look at these to make sure the suggestion was acknowledged/addressed

---
##### **10. Don't tolerate rudeness**
- Stand up for those who are the victims of rudeness, giving the offender the opportunity to adjust their attitude and behaviour.

---
##### **11. Be specific in replies to reviewers**
- Easy suggestions, such as variable changes, can easily be fixed
- For more difficult suggestions, replies to the reviewer should be detailed rather than ignored

---
##### **12. Thank your reviewers**
- Acknowledge those who have helped to improve your code.
<br>

Now let's take a look at a code review [example](https://buildtogether.tech/git-team/#code-reviews).

# **The Process**

---
<!--_color: white -->
<!--_backgroundColor: #f4a534 -->
## `Agile`

---
Agile is a bottom up approach to project management and software development that focuses on iterations and frequent feedback. 

It can also be extremely useful in a variety of fields that have small teams and constantly changing requirements - like student projects.

---
##### **Best for...**
- Constantly changing requirements rather than long-range planning
- Continuous communication with developers and users
- Small teams
- Daily progress

---
##### **Scrum**
- Scrum is an Agile methodology that breaks down development into short development cycles called *sprints*.

- Sprints are typically 2 weeks long, sometimes longer or shorter.

- Each sprint includes deciding what to build, desiging it, building it, testing it and delivering it.

---
##### **Stand-up Meetings**
- Stand-up meetings are a chance for everyone on the team to report what they accomplished the day before, what they're planning to work on and what's blocking them.

- Meetings are usually at the beginning of each day. 

- They give team members a chance to stay focused, get feedback and stay on track to meet the iteration's goals.

---

##### **Example**
**Yesterday:** Fixed the bug that was making the message file reader crash on accented characters, and added code to the HTML producer to display accented characters properly.

**Today:** Will get the message file reader to recognize links to images and load those images.

**Blockers:** What should the message file reader do if the image can't be found? Should it link to the ones it has, halt with an error message, or something else?

---
<!--_color: white -->
<!--_backgroundColor: #33857a -->
What do you notice about this example?

---
<!-- footer: " "-->
- Make each task no more than a day long, otherwise you could say you're working on the same thing for several days in a row.

- Small tasks also allow for feedback and redirection if needed.
