##### **Inequality vs. Inequity**
**Inequality:**
- Uneven distribution of resources
- Unbalanced conditions
- Usually quantitative in nature
<br>

**Inequity:**
- Avoidable differences arising from social circumstances
- The state of being unfair or unjust
- Typically qualitative in nature

Inequality usually emerges due to inequity.
<br>

**Can you think of any examples?**

---
1. Lower salaries for female employees stems from gender inequity

2. Job opportunities favouring white applicants stems from racial inequity

3. Higher rate of Indigenous children in the child welfare system stems from a long history of structural inequity

##### **The History of Residential Schools**
- The Residential Schools System dates back to 1870, which was government-funded and church-led

- The system's intention was to lead a cultural genocide to assimilate Indigenous children

- More than 130 schools were estabilshed with more than 150,000 Indigenous students attending

- Children were forcibly removed from their families

- Families who resisted faced fines and or jail time

---
![bg left cover](pics/Colonization.png)

- Children did not see their families for years or interact with their family within the schools, unable to speak their language or practice their culture

---
![bg right cover](pics/IRSburials.jpeg)
- Children received inadequate food, clothing, facilities, education, staff and medical treatment

- Children faced severe and constant abuse with mortality rates ranging between 30-60%

##### **Oral Histories**
- Using language such as *they* and *them* can create distance from ourselves and those we are speaking or learning about

- Instead, the second person can help us feel closer to the stories of survivors and their testimonies

- Oral histories is a significant practise for Indigenous Peoples. It is how knowledge is passed on. To respect the practice and values of Indigenous Peoples, we will engage with oral testimonies from survivors of the Residential School System

##### **Workshop**
Medicine wheels are used by some Indigenous peoples to represents elements of a whole person.

We'll use this tool as we listen to stories of Survivors and discuss all together.

---
**Physical:**
>Possible items can include the physical descriptions of the home setting before Residential School, the settings at school, or any descriptions of locations after school that stand out to students. This can include all healthy forms of affection and/or inappropriate and harmful physical contact. Sports and games played, and events could be included here. Acts of violence and abuse would also go here.

---
**Intellectual:**
>Possible items to be placed here include thoughts the students had, reflections and understandings about life before school, the school itself, or after their time in school that they share. Students may also note what Survivors learned in school, what they thought about that learning and other mental activities required by the school. Students may also note its absence.

---
**Spiritual:**
>Separating children from their family, customs, languages and traditional ways of being was thought to be the only way to force them into the dominant religions of Canada. Experiences students could place here would be spiritual teachings from before Residential School, during, and after. Students may find that they put a lot into this category when Survivors talk about their return to culture, family and language as part of their healing journey

---
**Emotional:** 
>There are likely to be many emotional moments in the Indigenous Survivors’ Oral Testimony. Students may struggle with determining whether to put something in this category or another category. Consider physical abuse – because of the nature of the experience, it may seem like it should go in physical; however, because of a strong response of a Survivor, it may seem to belong in the emotional category. Selecting either or both categories are accurate and demonstrates the multi-faceted impacts on Indigenous children

Let's discuss the stories that we heard and our medicine wheels
<br>
- What categorical decisions did we make?

- What was challenging about these decisions?

- Did you find yourselves noting things you might not otherwise have if you had not been asked specifically for these categories ?

What are the consquences of this history for Indigenous Peoples today?

##### **Intergenerational Impacts**
The legacy of Residential Schools have had lasting impacts on Survivors and their families. Some include:
- Alcohol and drug abuse
- Educational blocks
- Higher rates of suicide
- Destruction of social support networks
- Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls
- Higher rate of children in the child welfare system (an extention of Residential Schools)

---
##### **TRC: Calls to Action**
To redress the legacy of colonization and residential schools, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission drafted 94 calls to action in 2012. Since then, only 14 have been completed.

Reading these call to actions can give us a good idea of some of the inequities that exist today

---
>**1.ii.** Providing adequate resources to enable Aboriginal communities and child-welfare organizations to keep Aboriginal families together where it is safe to do so, and to keep children in culturally appropriate environments, regardless of where they reside.

---
>**6.** We call upon the federal government to develop with Aboriginal groups a joint strategy to eliminate educational and employment gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.

---
>**23.** We call upon all levels of government to:<br>
**i.** Increase the number of Aboriginal professionals working in the health-care field.<br>
**ii.** Ensure the retention of Aboriginal health-care providers in Aboriginal communities <br>
**iii.** Provide cultural competency training for all health-care professionals

---
>**30.** We call upon the federal, provincial, and territorial governments to commit to eliminating the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in custody over the next decade, and to issue detailed annual reports that monitor and evaluate progress in doing so.

How does this relate to data science?

How do we utilize this knowledge as we practice data science?

It's important as we move forward to understand inequity and the inequality it has produced. 
<br>
It is not enough to discuss crime without discussing the overrepresentation of racialized people in the justice system.

---
![bg right cover](pics/protest2.png)
It is not enough to discuss healthcare without discussing the difference of treatment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.

---
![bg left cover](pics/protest3.png)
It's not enough to discuss the child welfare system without discussing the history of Residential Schools and the impact on Indigenous Peoples.
